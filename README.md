## F.A.Q
### WHY?
The pack is inspired by old modpacks i used to play back in the days, like Hack/Mine and YogBox, i also love hexxit and i think its a solid base to develop something ambitious that feel like those old modpacks merged together.

### Why Technic and not curseforge???
I use linux as my daily driver and curseforge support for linux is very limited for Minecraft.

### Did you test all those mods together? 
Yes, im playing this modpack right now with my brother in two variations, ill try to address any compatibility issue that might appear. THe STABLE version is what im playing mostly and working so far, no crashes, anything besides that may have issues but no instant crashes or anything like that.

### Do i need to have a beefy pc for this modpack?
