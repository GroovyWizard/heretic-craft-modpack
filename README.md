# Heretic Craft
Heretic Craft is a Technic Launcher modpack made to expand on top of Hexxit with a heavy focus on RPG elements, new armors, weapons, magic and a better progression.
## WHY?
The pack is inspired by old modpacks i used to play back in the days, like Hack/Mine and YogBox, i also love hexxit and i think its a solid base to develop something ambitious that feel like those old modpacks merged together.

## Why Technic and not curseforge???
I use linux as my daily driver and curseforge support for linux is very limited regarding Minecraft.

## Did you test all those mods together? 
Yes, im playing this modpack right now with my brother in two variations, ill try to address any compatibility issue that might appear.
