## F.A.Q
### Stable? Bleeding Edge? 
Ive divided this modpack in 3 versions based on testing im doing while playing and looking for some bugs. 
- Stable releases are beign tested for a long time (Months) and i can guarantee almost 100% compatibility;
- Bleeding Edge releases have some known minor bugs or very specific crashes that im still trying to solve but should work correctly;
- Testing releases have game breaking bugs, frequent crashes (specially related to conflicting ids) that will take some time to solve, so use at your own risk;
- Note: Only stable releases are available on Technic!


### WHY?
The pack is inspired by old modpacks i used to play back in the days, like Hack/Mine and YogBox, i also love hexxit and i think its a solid base to develop something ambitious that feel like those old modpacks merged together.

### Why Technic and not curseforge???
I use linux as my daily driver and curseforge support for linux is very limited for Minecraft.

### Did you test all those mods together? 
Yes, im playing this modpack right now with my brother in two variations, ill try to address any compatibility issue that might appear. THe STABLE version is what im playing mostly and working so far, no crashes, anything besides that may have issues but no instant crashes or anything like that.
